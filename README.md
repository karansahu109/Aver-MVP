Aver — MVP

A map-based platform (interface) for real-world social interactions powered by gamified experiences.

Aver connects digital actions with physical locations, enabling users to interact, compete, earn, and engage through a shared geographic interface.


The map is the primary interface where users can:

Discover nearby activities and interactions

Participate in real-world challenges

Perform social or economic actions tied to locations

Gain rewards, XP, or monetary outcomes

The goal is to merge social interaction + gamification + locality into one system.
